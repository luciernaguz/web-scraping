# web-scraping-challenge
### Web Scraping Bootcamp Challenge

## A very complete challenge to meet, it was interesting to put into practice what was learned, however it took a long time to solve the scrap.
It is not complete at all, the twitter part turned out to be more complicated despite dedicating the most time to it, it was incredibly that of so many combinations I did not manage to obtain any information, in itself a Mission that took too long without anything back.

The whole project is included in the Mission to Mars folder, the Jupyter Notebook is inside, which is duplicated in "scrape_mars.py", "app.py" basically contains the main function that helps to generate the local site "http: / /127.0.0.1:5000/" which allows us to invoke the index.html to be able to reach the Mission to Mars, we can reach the News, the Featured Image, the information manually entered about twitter weather mars and finally the hemispheres.

Through the Scrape New Data button, we can go in search of new information, the update will take a while.
